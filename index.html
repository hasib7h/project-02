            <h2>What is freelance photography?</h2>
            <em>Last updated: 27 May 2022</em>

            <p>If you’re a beginner photographer who wants to start a career in freelancing, you might be wondering what does a freelance photographer do? In simple words, a freelance photographer is someone who takes on clients, clicks photographs as per the requirement, and charges them for it. As a freelance photographer, you get to choose what type of work you take on and turn down assignments that don't align with your style or interests. Working as a freelance photographer, you market yourself through social media, digital portfolios or websites by displaying your work to find potential clients.</p>
            <p>I spoke to two successful photographers for more insights to make the process easier to understand.</p>
            <p> <b>Mithila Jariwala</b> <i> is a documentary photographer whose work focuses on grassroots-development organisations. Currently working as a communications consultant, photography continues to remain her hustle.</i></p>

            </div>

            <br>
            <p class="caption1">Siddhartha Joshi considers photography a successful side-hustle. Long before the digital revolution, Siddhartha had a travel blog for which he clicked pictures. This, eventually, got him assignments, and he turned it into a source of income.</p>
            
            <div class="imgbox">

            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="backbox"><b>Both Mithila and Siddhartha began their journeys as passionate travellers.</b> While Mithila eventually branched out into documentary photography, Siddhartha developed an interest in clicking portraits.</p>
